# Getting Started with Weather App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You'll be seeing a small form asking you to fill zipcode. Once you fill the form and hit check weather button you'll see the current weather and 5-day forecast for the given zipcode within US.

You can change unit of measure to see the respective converted units without re-submitting the form.

I have used few util functions to get the info not available on fetch call, such as wind direction, 12Hr time format.
